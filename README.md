# gen-queries
This will automatically generate queries to be run from another program in threads.

## This program will start by reading the database as provided by the 
user. It will read all of the tables in that database and then all of 
the columns in each table.

## It will then generate SQL queries to select MAX, AVG and MIN of each 
column in the table.
